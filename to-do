To-do:

Time_srs.py:
- make times match automatically with times of model
- sort out the time change ffs
- make headers on AWS data file load in automatically
- re-write to return dictionary of vars, like in cloud scripts
- load in each res first, rather than doing it each time to speed up script
- Make masking more reader-friendly
